The outlined components and diagram illustrate my approach to designing a WordPress solution optimized for performance, availability, and resilience within Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

This architecture leverages **Cloud Run** for efficient, on-demand processing, **Cloud Storage multi-region buckets** for highly available static content delivery, and a **global HTTP(S) Load Balancer** with **Cloud CDN** to ensure low latency and scalability during high-traffic events. Given the infrequent update requirements of the WordPress application, this setup represents a simple yet robust solution that minimizes infrastructure management overhead while maximizing uptime and responsiveness employing cloud native architecture.


# Component Features & Flow from Entry to Backend 

---
Load Balancer

Key Features:
- CDN Configured to cache requests, serve users, and reduce load on infrastructure during high volume events. 
- Use of 2 cloud storage buckets serving as backends for routing based user proximity
- Termination of SSL Certs handled within LB proxy 

*Summary*:
	 Use of the load balancer to dynamically route traffic based on target regions.
	 And with the added CDN configuration; cached content is delivered quickly with less load on the infrastucture during traffic spikes.

Storage buckets 

Key Features:
- Multi Region buckets for high availability and failover - Provisioned in US and Asia Pacific
- Serves as static endpoint and host to static HTML Files Generated by word press
- Native Scaling managed by GCP. More robust due to multi region replication.

*Summary*:
	 The use of storage buckets compliments the outline by serving as a host for the static content generated by the WordPress server; whilst enabling low Usage of the Database. Buckets are scalable to an unlimited extent, and through the use of multi region replication, availability is enhanced significantly.

Word press image configured on cloud run instance 

Key Features:
- Using Plugins such as WP2 Static or Simply Static, we generate and export HTML files to our host buckets through WordPress
- Word-press Image is built and maintained through cloud build CI/CD Pipeline
- Necessary plugins are incorporated before docker containerization 
- Database credentials are accessed via secrets configured in environment variables.
- Word press image is modified to use environment variables linking it to the credentials of the SQL instance
- Cloud run instance is installed in VPC Subnetwork through VPC access connector
- Logging exported directly into cloud operations. 

*Summary*:
	This setup utilizes cloud run for the benefits of containerization with minimal management overhead. Cloud run also has the benefit of processing requests and resources on demand. 
	Logging is also natively imported into operations and can be further enhanced using PromQL metrics if sidecars are configured.

Managed Cloud SQL Database 

Key Features:
- Private IP enabled
- Access Credentials Stored in secret manager

*Summary*:
	 Standard Managed SQL Database to serve Word press configuration

Network Connectivity and Access tools 
- VPC Access Connector
	 - Enables private IP for Database host, under a prescribed a logical CIDR
	 - Enables Cloud run instance deployment within VPC Environment.  
- Private Access
	 - Enables cloud storage requests on private backbone without public exposure using internal DNS `gsutil ls gs://my-bucket` 
- Load balancer
	 - Used to solidify infrastructure for high volume scenarios and globally routing traffic between 2 multi region bucket endpoints.
- Secrete Manager
         - Used to store access credentials for database in a secure fashion, so hardcoded sensitive values are not exposed.
